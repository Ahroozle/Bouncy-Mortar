# Bouncy Mortar
A small project I messed around with off of an idea I had in my head for a game (which is sadly long gone now). This is an incredibly old project that shows a snapshot of how I coded months to a year ago.

I was experimenting with gameplay driven by a small set of mechanics, even so far as to remove the ability to move from the roster of things you can do to solely focus on firing a cannon. I also encountered a problem where staying upright was a major issue and added some (very flawed) code to remedy it. I kept it the same because I felt that the stuttering movement when the player moves along the ground added character to the game and a feeling of impact to hits.

To anyone looking to open the project, this opens in Unity 5.1.3f1, or at least 5.1.3
